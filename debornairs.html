                            <h3>DEBORNAIRS</h3>
    <p>Debonairs Pizza is a South African based pizza restaurant chain franchise founded in 1991 by Craig MacKenzie and Andrew Harvey. MacKenzie came up with the idea and business model to found the company following a gap-year trip to Los Angeles when he was a student at the University of KwaZulu-Natal.[2] The first restaurants were established in Pietermaritzburg, followed by Umhlanga and then Durban. The chain expanded rapidly and was acquired by Famous Brands in 1999.</p>
